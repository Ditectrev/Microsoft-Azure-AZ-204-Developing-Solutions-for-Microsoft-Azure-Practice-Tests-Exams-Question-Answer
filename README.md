| 193   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to ContentUploadService. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Azure Active Directory: Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 212   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to ContentUploadService. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Azure Active Directory: Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 215   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to ContentUploadService. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Azure Active Directory: Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`.

| 219   | [You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to ContentUploadService. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Azure Active Directory: Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version.

### You are a developer for Contoso, Ltd. The company has a social networking website that is developed as a Single Page Application (SPA). The main web application for the social networking website loads user uploaded content from blob storage. You are developing a solution to monitor uploaded data for inappropriate content. The following process occurs when users upload content by using the SPA: Messages are sent to ContentUploadService. Content is processed by ContentAnalysisService. After processing is complete, the content is posted to the social network or a rejection message is posted in its place. The `ContentAnalysisService` is deployed with Azure Container Instances from a private Azure Container Registry named `contosoimages`. The solution will use eight CPU cores. Azure Active Directory: Contoso, Ltd. uses Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for both internal and guest accounts. Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to store the user agreements. Where should you store the agreement after it is completed?

Requirements: `ContentAnalysisService` - The company's data science group built `ContentAnalysisService` which accepts user generated content as a string and returns a probable value for inappropriate content. Any values over a specific threshold must be reviewed by an employee of Contoso, Ltd. You must create an Azure Function named `CheckUserContent` to perform the content checks. Costs: You must minimize costs for all Azure services. Manual review: To review content, the user must authenticate to the website portion of the `ContentAnalysisService` using their Azure AD credentials. The website is built using React and all pages and API endpoints require authentication. In order to review content a user must be part of a ContentReviewer role. All completed reviews must include the reviewer's email address for auditing purposes. High availability: All services must run in multiple regions. The failure of any service in a region must not impact overall application availability. Monitoring: An alert must be raised if the `ContentUploadService` uses more than 80 percent of available CPU cores. Security: You have the following security requirements: Any web service accessible over the Internet must be protected from cross site scripting attacks. All websites and services must use SSL from a valid root certificate authority. Azure Storage access keys must only be stored in memory and must be available only to the service. All Internal services must only be accessible from internal Virtual Networks (VNets). All parts of the system must support inbound and outbound traffic restrictions. All service calls must be authenticated by using Azure AD. User agreements: When a user submits content, they must agree to a user agreement. The agreement allows employees of Contoso, Ltd. to review content, store cookies on user devices, and track user's IP addresses. Information regarding agreements is used by multiple divisions within Contoso, Ltd. User responses must not be lost and must be available to all parties regardless of individual service uptime. The volume of agreements is expected to be in the millions per hour. Validation testing: When a new version of the `ContentAnalysisService` is available the previous seven days of content must be processed with the new version to verify that the new version does not significantly deviate from the old version. Issues: Users of the `ContentUploadService` report that they occasionally see HTTP `502` responses on specific pages. Code - `ContentUploadService` - `ApplicationManifest`. You need to deploy the CheckUserContent Azure Function. The solution must meet the security and cost requirements. Which hosting model should you use?
